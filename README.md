## Tod

A tiny todoist CLI program. Takes simple input and dumps it in your inbox, does not currently support natural language input.

Will ask for your Todoist API token on first run, and store the token in plaintext in `~/todoist_token.cfg`. You can obtain your token from [Todoist Preferences](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations)
